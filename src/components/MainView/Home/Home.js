        <em><strong>Educational websites</strong></em> can include 
     websites that have games,videos or topic related resources that
     act as tools to enhance learning and supplement classroom teaching.
    These websites help make the process of learning entertaining and 
    attractive to the student, especially in todayâ€™s age.
    <hr/>
    While there are many advantages of such websites, we also need 
    to be aware of the negatives. Students need to be guided properly.
    Without proper guidance, students may find resources and content
    that are not reliable or do not align with the direction of the
    teaching in class. Some websites are huge and offer a massive 
    variety of games and resources. Students may be easily 
    distracted on such websites and end up spending time on 
    activities that are either below their level or do not
    complement or add to the classroom teaching.
